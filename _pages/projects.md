Graph Approaches for Adaptive AR
======
* Course Project for CS 292F: Machine Learning on Graphs (Spring 2022)
* Problem: assigning objects of a virtual scene to new positions in an arbitrary real-world location.
* Compared how purely geometrical algorithms and Graph ML techniques perform on this problem 

Evaluation of Subretinal Prosthetic Implant (PRIMA) Simulation for Visual Acuity
======
* Course Project for CS 291A: Bionic Vision (Fall 2021)
* Built a gaze-contingent VR experiment to simulate PRIMA prosthesis 
* To evaluate the visual acuity that can be acheived by PRIMA, sighted participants can participate in this experiment and perform Landolt-C acuity test
* Developed using HTC Vive Pro Headset, Unity and [pulse2percept](https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

noGram
======
* Course Project for CS 291A: Scalable Internet Services (Fall 2021)
* Implemented a basic Social Network Web app using Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database
* Performed different tSung Load tests to analyze bottlenecks and scalability to better handle traffic
* Performed Cost Analysis on AWS to determine best hardware configuration for a user arrival rate

Flick Gesture Interaction in Augmented Reality: AR Carrom
======
* Course Project for CS 291A: Future User Interfaces (Spring 2021)
* Built an AR app with a flick gesture mechanic that utilizes hand gestures and doesn’t rely on any external hardware
* Developed using Unity, ARCore and Manomotion

Performance Analysis and Optimization on Edge AI devices
======
* Course Project for CS 263: Runtime Systems (Spring 2021)
* Aim: To study Optimization Techniques to increase inference performance on Edge devices
* Studied Nvidia’s Nsight profiling tool and compared performance of basic AI models using TensorRT on Jetson Nano

Facial Emotion Recognition
======
* Course Project for CS 265: Machine Intelligence (Winter 2021)
* Aim: Given an image, identify the emotion expressed within the image
* Compared the performance of different classifiers (SVM, CNN, GAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, AutoEncoders(AE), Convolutional AE) on FER 2013 dataset
* Built a Super Resolution model using AEs to study the effects of super resolution images on classification task

Cancer subtype detection using Human Gene Expression data
======
* Bachelor’s Project, Advisor: [Dr. Clint P. George](https://clintpgeorge.github.io/)
* Aim: Clustering and detection of different cancer types using the Gene Expression data through Unsupervised Clustering & dimensionality reduction techniques to help in diagnostic and to reveal possible previously unknown cancer subtypes.
* Studied Autoencoder model and implemented it on Breast Cancer Data using Keras API to get a reduced representation of the gene data which retains the important information.
* Formulated possible optimizing ideas to get better reduced representation so that the model can generalize to all cancer types.

Bird Speech Recognition
======
* Course Project for Introduction to Machine Learning (Spring 2019)
* Built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) model to classify Bird species using their sound recording.
* Implemented Spectrogram, Short Fast Fourier transform (FFT) & Gaussian HMM using Python.
