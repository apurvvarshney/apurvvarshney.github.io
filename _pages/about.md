Hi! If you haven't alredy guessed, my name is Apurv. I am currently a Masters student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I received a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Goa. At IIT Goa, I worked with Prof. Clint George on Cancer subtype detection using Human Gene Expression data for my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis.

My research interest lies in Human Computer Interaction(HCI) and AI. Being a visual arts enthusiast, I find the creativity and imagination associated with this field intriguing. Apart from my academic life, I enjoy photography, playing tennis and watching F1.

For a detailed list of my projects and achievements, do check out my CV.
