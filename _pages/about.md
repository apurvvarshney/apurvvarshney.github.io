Hi! If you haven't already guessed, my name is Apurv. I am currently a Masters student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interest lies in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Deep Learning. Being a visual arts enthusiast, I find the creativity and imagination associated with this field intriguing. I am currently working in the [Bionic Vision Lab](https://bionicvisionlab.org/) on AR/VR projects to solve blindness and low vision.

Prior to joining UCSB, I completed my B. Tech in Computer Science & Engg. from Indian Institute of Technology, Goa in 2020. At IIT Goa, I worked with Prof. Clint George on Cancer subtype detection using Human Gene Expression data for my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis.

Apart from my academic life, I enjoy [photography](https://apurvvarshney.github.io/photography/), playing tennis and watching F1, although not all at the same time.

Do check out my one-page [Resume](/files/Resume.pdf). For a detailed list of my projects and achievements, see other sections.
