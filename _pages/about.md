Hi there! I am Apurv Varshney. I am a Ph.D. student in the [Bionic Vision Lab](https://bionicvisionlab.org/), UCSB  advised by Prof. [Michael Beyeler](https://cs.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/michael-beyeler). My academic journey centers around the convergence of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Vision, with the aim of revolutionizing Bionic Vision. Being a visual arts enthusiast, I find the creativity and imagination associated with this field intriguing. I am trying to harness Mixed Reality (MR) to enhance accessibility and address challenges faced by individuals with blindness and low vision. Check [here](https://bionicvisionlab.org/people/varshney_apurv/) to learn more about the projects I am part of.

Before joining UCSB, I completed my B. Tech in Computer Science & Engg. from Indian Institute of Technology, Goa. Here, I worked with Prof. [Clint George](https://clintpgeorge.github.io/) on detecting Breast Cancer subtypes using only Human Gene Expression data for my Bachelorâ€™s Thesis.

Apart from my academic life, I enjoy [photography](https://apurvvarshney.github.io/photography/), biking, and watching Formula 1, although not all simultaneously.

Do check out my [Resume](/files/Resume.pdf) for a snapshot of my capabilities and accomplishments.
